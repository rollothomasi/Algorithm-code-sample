(1)for the program of stringToLong,you can enter the numbers for a lot of time,and see the results under different situation.The program support negative and positive numbers based on 10,and you can check if the input and the output are uniform.below is an example of the command line and the output.


76575764
the number tranfered is:76575764
58587585657
the number tranfered is:58587585657
89685634243567898765432456789087654345678908765432456789

the number transfered is:-456476687



(2)for the program of trinary tree,we can input several numbers first and use any alphabet that is not a number to mark the end of the input,the we will get a result of a printed tree(in the vertical direction), the trinary tree has an insert and delete method quite familiar with the binary tree.
But for the delete method who has many sam value nodes in it,we delete the leaf first.

the input may be like this:
please insert a sequence of numbers:
5 7 9 4 2 2 a

  9
 7
5
 4
  22

please list a sequence of numbers you want to delete:
5 a

 9
7
 4
  22




hereâ€™s another example:

please insert a sequence of numbers:
